Hi, my name is Anzhelika. I am a frontend developer. And you are looking my self introduction.

### About Me

I'm twenty-eight years old, I live in Zhodino, Belarus. My husband, young son and two cats live with me. This is my big family.

I'm an economist by education. I've been studying in Pinsk at the Polesie State University and working in a bank as a currency control specialist for six years.
A year ago, in March, when the quarantine began, I decided to change my job. I want to have a job that doesn't depend on my location.

I completed a development course at the My Freedom IT school, but it's not enough knowledge. I studied on my own and I also started to learn English. It was difficult because I have a son who is two years old.
On the plus side, he knows the English alphabet and can count in English to twenty.

In March I got into RSS-Shcool. It was very intense. I gained in-depth knowledge of CSS, HTML, OOP, Webpack, Java Script, Type Script. My hard skills are: GIT, HTML, CSS. I did [Virtual piano](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/anzhelikamikulich-JSFEPRESCHOOL/drum-kit/), [Photo filter](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/anzhelikamikulich-JSFEPRESCHOOL/Fotofilter/), [Zoo website](https://anzhelikamikulich.github.io/Online-Zoo/online-zoo/pages/Landing/index.html), [Museum website](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/anzhelikamikulich-JSFE2021Q3/museum-dom/), [WildLife](https://anzhelikamikulich-wildlife.netlify.app), [BikeShop](https://anzhelikamikulich.github.io/firstproject_Adaptiv/), [Momentum](https://anzhelikamikulich-momentum.netlify.app/) and [Match-game](https://anzhelikamikulich-match-match-game.netlify.app/).

I've got a portfolio on githab. Now I am learning React and doing the school's tasks. This is very interesting for me. I like communicating with students, listening to live-streams, and reading mentor advice. It's a lot of work.
This course is very important for me, it's my ticket to a new life. I really want to become a good and in-demand specialist in the IT sphere. I devote a lot of time to it. Sometimes nights are sleepless, especially before deadlines. If you are a student, you understand me.
Thanks for taking the time to watch the video! Have a great day and good luck with your studies! Bye!
